These were by far the best cryptology challenges I’ve had the pleasure of doing in a CTF. They were fun, difficult, unique, and very rewarding. In hindsight, there really wasn’t any close staring at the code for bugs or googling for similar problems in past CTFs for any of these challenges. Most of them were just good ol’ math, and not extremely difficult math either.
