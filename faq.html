  <h3>What are CTFs?</h3>

  <p>
    CTFs are computer security competitions that contain challenges that must
    be solved in order to recover a "flag" (a specially-formatted string). These
    challenges often require knowledge in fields such as reverse engineering,
    cryptanalysis, scripting, and binary exploitation.
